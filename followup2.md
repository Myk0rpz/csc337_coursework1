{(aim|}
Observing what type of feature there is and how frequent they show up around Europe. (people can click on a specific featureType and then it would show all instances of that featuretype in the map)
{|aim)}

{(vistype|}
ScatterPlot with GeoMap background
{|vistype)}

{(vismapping|}

x position
: latitude of location

y position
: longitude of location

{|vismapping)}

{(dataprep|}
Data was agregated by FeatureType
{|dataprep)}

{(limitations|}
A lot of data points within a small setting, zooming would very much help. Also creating points to be invisible after selecting one FeatureType would make visualising it easier
