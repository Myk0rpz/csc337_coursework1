{(vismapping|}

x position
: latitude of location

y position
: longitude of location

{|vismapping)}

{(dataprep|}
Data was agregated by TimePeriod
{|dataprep)}

{(limitations|}
Creating points to be invisible after selecting one TimePeriod would make visualising it easier. More information on what is selected would be more beneficial
